        <!-- Section 1: Introduction, My role, and Challenge -->
        <section class="case-section-1">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This project was developed collaboratively by a team of three, aiming to create a digital application
                that fosters increased engagement with cultural heritage sites in Sweden. The application is
                designed to not only encourage visits to these sites but also to enhance users learning experiences and
                deepen
                their understanding of cultural history.
                Key features of the application include the ability to explore cultural heritage sites nearby, plan
                longer routes to discover multiple locations, and engage in interactive activities. Users can solve
                mysteries related to historical events and compete against others, making the exploration process
                both educational and entertaining.
                By combining practical tools for trip planning with gamified elements, the application seeks to
                motivate users of all ages to engage actively with Sweden's rich cultural heritage while fostering a
                sense of
                curiosity and community.</p>
            <h3>My role</h3>
            <p>In this project, I focused on understanding and addressing user needs. Through research and testing,
                I identified gaps in current solutions for visiting cultural heritage sites, explored what engages
                users, and gathered insights into desired features.
                I contributed to ideation, concept development, and prototyping, using prototypes as tools to test
                and refine ideas. By integrating the user perspective and aligning design decisions with both user and
                client goals, I ensured the application was engaging, educational, and user-focused.</p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>A key challenge was designing an application that catered to the diverse needs of users, from
                casual visitors to heritage enthusiasts. Identifying barriers such as lack of awareness and
                limited engagement opportunities required thorough research and careful consideration.
                Another challenge was balancing gamified features like mysteries and competitions with the
                authenticity and educational value of the cultural heritage experience. Ensuring these elements
                enhanced rather than detracted from the core purpose demanded iterative testing and refinement.

                    <p>Surveys and interviews were conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current
                        practices and challenges associated with visiting cultural heritage sites. This research
                        sought
                        to explore how individuals currently engage with cultural landmarks, including their
                        behaviors,
                        preferences, and motivations. A key focus was to identify the needs and expectations of
                        visitors, such as what they require to plan and enjoy visits, and the features that could
                        enhance their overall experience.

                        varying priorities and expectations of users, ensuring that the design solution would
                        address
                        both fundamental and nuanced requirements effectively.
                        To deepen the understanding of the target audience, detailed personas were developed. These
                        personas captured key user archetypes, outlining their goals, behaviors, strengths, and
                        weaknesses. This process not only humanized the data but also allowed for a more empathetic
                        approach to design.

                        possible to

                        were effective and which ones did not meet expectations. This process also provided us with
