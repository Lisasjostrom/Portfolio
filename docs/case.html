            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This project was developed collaboratively by a team of three, aiming to create a digital application
                that fosters increased engagement with cultural heritage sites in Sweden. The application is
                designed to
                not only encourage visits to these sites but also to enhance users’ learning experiences and deepen
                their understanding of cultural history.

                Key features of the application include the ability to explore cultural heritage sites nearby, plan
                longer routes to discover multiple locations, and engage in interactive activities. Users can solve
                mysteries related to historical events and compete against others, making the exploration process
                both
                educational and entertaining.

                By combining practical tools for trip planning with gamified elements, the application seeks to
                motivate
                users of all ages to engage actively with Sweden’s rich cultural heritage while fostering a sense of
                curiosity and community.</p>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>In this project, I focused on understanding and addressing user needs. Through research and testing,
                I
                identified gaps in current solutions for visiting cultural heritage sites, explored what engages
                users,
                and gathered insights into desired features.

                I contributed to ideation, concept development, and prototyping, using prototypes as tools to test
                and
                refine ideas. By integrating the user perspective and aligning design decisions with both user and
                client goals, I ensured the application was engaging, educational, and user-focused.</p>
            <h3>Challange</h3>
            <p>A key challenge was designing an application that catered to the diverse needs of users, from
                casual visitors to heritage enthusiasts. Identifying barriers such as lack of awareness and
                limited engagement opportunities required thorough research and careful consideration.

                Another challenge was balancing gamified features like mysteries and competitions with the
                authenticity and educational value of the cultural heritage experience. Ensuring these elements
                enhanced rather than detracted from the core purpose demanded iterative testing and refinement.

                <div class="text-image-row-4">
                    <p>Surveys and interviews were conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current
                        practices and challenges associated with visiting cultural heritage sites. This research
                        sought
                        to explore how individuals currently engage with cultural landmarks, including their
                        behaviors,
                        preferences, and motivations. A key focus was to identify the needs and expectations of
                        visitors, such as what they require to plan and enjoy visits, and the features that could
                        enhance their overall experience.

                        on
                        user needs and preferences. The diagram helped identify key features desired by users,
                        focusing
                        on elements that create a meaningful and engaging experience. It highlighted aspects such as
                        enhancing entertainment, fostering engagement and motivation, improving accessibility, and
                        providing educational and pedagogical value.

                        and tertiary needs of the target audience. This step was essential to gain insights into the
                        varying priorities and expectations of users, ensuring that the design solution would
                        address
                        both fundamental and nuanced requirements effectively.
                        To deepen the understanding of the target audience, detailed personas were developed. These
                        personas captured key user archetypes, outlining their goals, behaviors, strengths, and
                        weaknesses. This process not only humanized the data but also allowed for a more empathetic
                        approach to design.

                        Sketches were created to explore and test different concepts through user testing. These
                        sketches allowed for a quick visualization of several ideas and solutions, making it
                        possible to
                        compare and evaluate them. By testing various concepts, we were able to identify which
                        elements
                        were effective and which ones did not meet expectations. This process also provided us with
                        new
                        insights and ideas that we might not have considered otherwise. The feedback from user
                        testing
                        played a crucial role in improving the design, adjusting functionality, and ensuring that
                        the
                        solution best met the needs and expectations of the users. This iterative approach helped
                        refine

                        on functionality rather than visual design. These simple prototypes allowed us to validate
                        core
                        features and interactions early in the process. Through user testing, we gathered valuable
                        feedback, uncovering new insights and ideas. This iterative process helped refine the
                        prototypes, adjust features, and explore alternative solutions based on user input. The
                        insights
                        gained were crucial for optimizing the design and ensuring the final product met user needs,
